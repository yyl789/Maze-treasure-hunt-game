# Maze Treasure Q-learning Project

## Overview
This project is a maze treasure hunt game based on the Q-learning algorithm. The agent learns to navigate the maze, avoid traps, and reach the goal through reinforcement learning.

## Features
1. **Multiple difficulty levels**: Simple (5x5), Medium (8x8), Hard (10x10)
2. **Complete Q-learning implementation**: balances exploration and exploitation
3. **Visualization**: Pygame UI
4. **Training and testing**: supports training agents and evaluating performance
5. **Data visualization**: generates training curves and result analysis

## Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
